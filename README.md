### Tip

TIP is a tiny imperative programming language implemented in Rust.

The ultimate goal of this project is to implement excerscies from [Static Program Analysis](http://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/).

Things that now supported:
 - [x] Parser (via lalrpop)
 - [x] Pretty AST-printer
 - [x] AST-based interpreter
 - [x] Per-function CFG dump to graphviz
 - [x] Basic type analisys (w/o polymorphism)
